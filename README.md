## Flask Project for Cardiac Arrest Prediction 

The code (includes HTML, CSS, python) uses Age, BMI, Cholesterol, glucose level, smoking status, drinking alcohol status to predict the possibility
of having Cardiac Arrest. 

A kaggle dataset was used in training the prediction model which was saved in pkl file format.

Herokuapp.com Free plan was used to deploy & test the code. All the data was sent to the main smart health website using POST method
 

 * [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
